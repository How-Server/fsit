# Changelog

## v2.6.2

### Fixed

- Crash during client startup due to oopsie daisy with `KeyBindingMixin`.
  Thanks [#47](https://github.com/rvbsm/fsit/issues/47)

## v2.6.1

### Changed

- Dismounting a player will try to find safe to dismount position
- Key bindings behaviour options were moved to the Mod Menu
- Seats will apply velocity only if it is big enough (`sitting.behaviour` is `Gravity`)

### Fixed

- `/fsit:client allow` and `/fsit:client restrict` did opposite things
- Hybrid key bindings mode was working wrong

## v2.6.0

**Bundles of Bravery** drop

### Added

- Better(?) configuration migrations
- Asynchronous configuration update packet handler
- Packed with Shadow and Proguard Gradle plugins
- `sitting.apply_gravity` and `sitting.allow_in_air` had a little conflict and were replaced with `sitting.behaviour`.
  It can have three values:
    - `nothing`: does nothing
    - `discard`: discards seats if they do not have any supporting block underneath them
    - `gravity`: applies movement to seats, e.g. gravity, getting pushed by pistons, fluids
- `sitting.should_center` option that controls if seats should be placed in the centre of a block
- Traditional Chinese translation by @yichifauzi at [#45](https://github.com/rvbsm/fsit/pull/45). Thank you!

### Changed

- Configuration category `on_double_sneak` was renamed to `on_sneak` (will automatically migrate)
- Seats trying to find safe to dismount position
- Seats checks for entity collisions too (like boats), when `sitting.behaviour` is `Discard`
- Asynchronous configuration packet deserialization

### Fixed

- Option descriptions didn't show up in configuration menu (Mod Menu, YACL)
- Crash if configuration's numeric values were not in range
